<h1>Pacwoman</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>Pacwoman is a game project inspired by the classic Pac-Man. The game is implemented in Java and features a fully functional arcade-style gameplay system.

The game includes a maze where players control Pacwoman, collecting points while avoiding AI-controlled enemies. The AI utilizes pathfinding algorithms to chase the player, creating a challenging experience. The game also includes power-ups that temporarily grant the player advantages, such as invincibility or increased speed.

The project consists of multiple Java classes responsible for different aspects of the game, including game logic, user interface rendering, and collision detection. A scoring system keeps track of the player's progress, and the game state is managed dynamically to handle enemy movement and player interactions effectively. The graphical interface is built using Java's built-in libraries, providing a simple but effective visual representation of the game world.</p>
